Use this section to understand what OngoingAI Gateway can enforce and observe in
production traffic.
You can use these pages to plan rollout order, configuration, and verification.

## Use this section when

- You are planning a production gateway deployment.
- You need to map controls to security, reliability, and cost goals.
- You want a page-by-page path from capability overview to implementation.

## Read in this order

1. [Gateway auth, RBAC, and key lifecycle](/gateway/capabilities/gateway-auth-rbac-and-key-lifecycle)
   for tenant access control.
2. [Routing and provider support](/gateway/capabilities/routing-and-provider-support)
   for upstream path and provider behavior.
3. [Tracing and audit logs](/gateway/capabilities/tracing-and-audit-logs) for
   request visibility and audit events.
4. [Analytics, cost, and token accounting](/gateway/capabilities/analytics-cost-and-token-accounting)
   for usage and spend reporting.
5. [Rate limiting and quotas](/gateway/capabilities/rate-limiting-and-quotas)
   for guardrails and abuse control.
6. [Storage backends and migrations](/gateway/capabilities/storage-backends-and-migrations)
   for runtime persistence and upgrade safety.
7. [Streaming and reliability](/gateway/capabilities/streaming-and-reliability)
   for low-latency stream behavior and failure semantics.
8. [Privacy and sensitive data handling](/gateway/capabilities/privacy-and-sensitive-data-handling)
   for redaction and payload-risk controls.
9. [Integrations and exporters](/gateway/capabilities/integrations-and-exporters)
   for integration planning.

## Available capability areas

- Gateway authentication and authorization enforcement.
- Provider routing across OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic paths.
- Trace capture, audit events, and analytics endpoints.
- Request limits and daily usage quotas.
- SQLite and Postgres storage with startup migration behavior.
- Streaming pass-through with async trace-write isolation.

## Expanding capability areas

- Privacy and sensitive-data handling policy depth.
- External integrations and exporter surfaces.

## What you should understand after reading

- Which controls enforce access and tenant boundaries.
- Which controls affect latency and streaming behavior.
- Which controls govern storage, migrations, and operational risk.
- Which capability pages are implementation-ready versus planning-oriented.

## Next steps

- [Review core architecture first](/gateway/core-concepts/index)
- [Review configuration schema and defaults](/gateway/reference/config-reference)
- [Review troubleshooting paths](/gateway/help/troubleshooting)
