Use this section to understand how OngoingAI Gateway works before you tune
configuration or enforce production policy.
You will learn how request forwarding, trace capture, privacy controls, and
tenant boundaries fit together.

## Use this section when

- You are designing a gateway deployment or rollout plan.
- You need a shared architecture model across platform, security, and
  application teams.
- You need to reason about privacy and tenant isolation behavior before enabling
  advanced controls.

## Read in this order

1. [Architecture](/gateway/core-concepts/architecture) for request-path and
   trace-path fundamentals.
2. [Traces and audit model](/gateway/core-concepts/traces-and-audit-model) for
   data model and event boundaries.
3. [Privacy model](/gateway/core-concepts/privacy-model) for storage and
   redaction behavior.
4. [Keys, workspaces, and tenancy](/gateway/core-concepts/keys-workspaces-and-tenancy)
   for identity scope and isolation rules.

## What you should understand after reading

- Where auth, capture, routing, and storage happen in the request lifecycle.
- Which trace data is always captured and which data is optional.
- How privacy controls change persisted trace content.
- How org and workspace scope is applied to access and analytics.

- [Configure tracing and audit operations](/gateway/capabilities/tracing-and-audit-logs)
- [Review configuration schema](/gateway/reference/config-reference)
