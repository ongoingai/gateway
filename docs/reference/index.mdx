Use this section when you need exact names, fields, flags, routes, and
permission terms.
You can use these pages as canonical lookup material while operating or
integrating the gateway.

## Use this reference when

- You need exact config keys, defaults, and validation constraints.
- You need CLI command syntax for scripts and runbooks.
- You need API route parameters and response fields for integration code.
- You need permission requirements for gateway auth decisions.

## Read in this order

1. [Config reference](/gateway/reference/config-reference) for YAML fields,
   defaults, and validation rules.
2. [Environment variable reference](/gateway/reference/env-var-reference) for
   env override names and parse behavior.
3. [CLI reference](/gateway/reference/cli-reference) for command usage, flags,
   and exit behavior.
4. [CLI JSON contracts](/gateway/reference/cli-json-contracts) for stable
   scripting schemas for `report` and `debug`.
5. [REST API reference](/gateway/reference/rest-api-reference) for endpoint
   contracts and request and response shapes.
6. [Authorization reference](/gateway/reference/authorization-reference) for
   roles, permissions, and route-to-permission mapping.

## What this section covers

- Configuration schema and operational defaults.
- Environment variable override behavior.
- CLI command contracts.
- CLI JSON scripting contracts.
- API contracts for health, traces, analytics, and gateway key management.
- Authorization policy vocabulary and enforcement mapping.

If a detail is missing, verify behavior in `openapi/openapi.yaml`,
`cmd/ongoingai/main.go`, `internal/api/`, and `internal/auth/auth.go`.
