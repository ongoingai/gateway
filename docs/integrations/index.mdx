Use this section to connect OngoingAI Gateway to external observability
platforms, collectors, and analytics pipelines.

## Available integrations

- **OpenTelemetry**: Export distributed traces and gateway metrics to any
  OTLP-compatible collector. Covers request spans, upstream proxy spans,
  tenant-scoped attributes, and operational metrics.

## Integration model

The gateway supports two complementary integration paths:

- **Push-based (OpenTelemetry)**: The gateway pushes traces and metrics to an
  OTLP collector over HTTP. You configure the collector endpoint and the gateway
  exports automatically.
- **Pull-based (JSON APIs)**: External systems poll gateway HTTP endpoints for
  trace records, analytics aggregates, and health status. See
  [Integrations and exporters](/gateway/capabilities/integrations-and-exporters)
  for pull-based patterns.

Both paths operate independently. You can use one or both depending on your
infrastructure.
