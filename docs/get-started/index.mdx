Use this section to go from zero to a working OngoingAI Gateway setup.
You will learn the gateway scope, install the binary, send first traffic, and
validate trace capture.

## Use this path when

- You are setting up OngoingAI Gateway for the first time.
- You need a short path to confirm proxy and trace behavior.
- You are preparing a deployment checklist for your team.

## Prerequisites

- You must have at least one provider API key:
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- You should have a shell with `curl` available.
- You should have port `8080` available for local runs.

## Read in this order

1. [What is OngoingAI Gateway](/gateway/get-started/what-is-ongoingai-gateway)
   to confirm scope, request flow, and product boundaries.
2. [Install](/gateway/get-started/install)
   to install and verify the `ongoingai` binary.
3. [Quickstart](/gateway/get-started/quickstart)
   to proxy one request and verify traces and analytics.
4. [Upgrade and compatibility](/gateway/get-started/upgrade-and-compatibility)
   to plan upgrades, backups, and rollback steps.

## Completion checklist

- The gateway starts and listens on your configured address.
- At least one provider request succeeds through the gateway.
- Trace data appears in the gateway API.
- You have a clear next step for auth, limits, or configuration hardening.
