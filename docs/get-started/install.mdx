Use this page to install OngoingAI Gateway and verify the binary works.

## Pick an installation path

Start with the install script unless you need containerized runtime boundaries
or custom build outputs.

- Use the install script for the fastest setup on a local machine.
- Use Docker when you want a container runtime.
- Build from source when you need to contribute or customize builds.

## Prerequisites

- For script install, you must have `curl`.
- For Docker install, you must have Docker.
- For source builds, you must have Go `1.24+` and `make`.

## Install with the script

1. Run the installer.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   curl -fsSL https://ongoing.ai/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Verify the installed binary.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   ongoingai version
   ```

   You should see a version string.

If you need to pin a version or change install behavior, set these variables
before step 1:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ONGOINGAI_VERSION` | Install a specific release instead of `latest`. |
| `ONGOINGAI_INSTALL_DIR` | Install to a custom directory instead of `/usr/local/bin`. |
| `ONGOINGAI_INSTALL_BASE_URL` | Download from a custom release base URL. |

## Install with Docker

1. Pull the image.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   docker pull ghcr.io/ongoingai/gateway:latest
   ```

2. Verify the container image.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   docker run --rm ghcr.io/ongoingai/gateway:latest version
   ```

   You should see a version string.

## Build from source

1. Clone the repository and build.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   git clone https://github.com/ongoingai/gateway.git
   cd gateway
   make build
   ```

2. Verify the built binary.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   ./bin/ongoingai version
   ```

   You should see a version string.

The build writes the binary to `./bin/ongoingai`.

### Build release targets

If you need release binaries for multiple platforms, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
make build-cross
```

Build outputs are written to `./dist/`.

## Default runtime behavior

After install, the gateway uses these defaults:

- Storage driver: SQLite at `./data/ongoingai.db`
- Provider route prefixes: `/openai` and `/anthropic`
- Body capture: off (`tracing.capture_bodies=false`)

See the [configuration reference](/gateway/reference/config-reference) for all
available settings.

## Troubleshooting

### `ongoingai` command is not found after script install

- Symptom: shell returns `command not found: ongoingai`.
- Cause: install directory is not in your `PATH`.
- Fix: add the install directory to `PATH` (default: `/usr/local/bin`), then
  start a new shell session.

### Script install fails with a permission error

- Symptom: installer cannot write the target binary.
- Cause: your user cannot write to the install directory.
- Fix: set `ONGOINGAI_INSTALL_DIR` to a writable directory, or install with a
  user that can write to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Source build fails with a Go toolchain error

- Symptom: `make build` fails with version or module errors.
- Cause: local Go version is below `1.24`.
- Fix: upgrade Go, then rerun `make build`.

## Next steps

- [Run the Quickstart](/gateway/get-started/quickstart) to send first traffic
  through the gateway and verify traces.
- [Review upgrade and compatibility](/gateway/get-started/upgrade-and-compatibility)
  for rollout planning.
