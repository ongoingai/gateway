Use this page to contribute code and docs with repository standards.
It covers local setup, required checks, and pull-request expectations.

## Use this guide when

- You are preparing your first pull request to OngoingAI Gateway.
- You are changing behavior in auth, proxy, trace, limits, or config code.
- You are updating product docs under `docs/`.

## Prerequisites

- Go `1.24` (from `go.mod`)
- `git` and `make`
- Optional: local Postgres for Postgres-backed integration tests

## Set up your local environment

1. Clone the repository and open the project directory.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   git clone https://github.com/ongoingai/gateway.git
   cd gateway
   ```

2. Build the gateway binary.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make build
   ```

3. Run the full test suite baseline.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make test
   ```

4. Run the gateway locally with default config.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make run
   ```

You should see startup logs with server address and configured providers.

## Build and test workflow before a pull request

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
   ```

2. Implement your change and update or add tests.
3. Format Go files.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make fmt
   ```

4. Run focused tests for changed areas first.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   go test ./internal/auth/
   ```

5. Run full and race checks before opening your pull request.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make test
   go test -race ./...
   ```

Placeholder:
- `BRANCH_NAME`: Short branch name for your change, for example
  `auth-deny-unmapped-routes`.

## Documentation contribution standards

If behavior changes, docs must change in the same pull request.

Requirements:
- Product docs live under `docs/` and must use `.mdx`.
- Every page must include `title` and `description` frontmatter.
- Writing must follow the
  [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Code and command examples should be copy/paste ready.

Frontmatter template:

```yaml filename="docs page frontmatter"
---
title: Page title
description: One to two sentence page summary.
---
```

If your editor does not preview `.mdx` files by default:

```json filename="VS Code settings.json"
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.mdx": "markdown"
  }
}
```

## Pull-request checklist

- Scope is clear and focused to one concern when possible.
- Security-sensitive paths remain fail-closed.
- Tenant boundaries (`org_id`, `workspace_id`) remain enforced.
- No secrets or raw API keys are logged or persisted.
- Behavior changes include tests.
- Docs and config examples are updated when behavior changes.
- CI checks pass.

## Common issues

### Tests fail only in Postgres-backed packages

- Symptom: Postgres integration tests fail or cannot connect.
- Cause: Missing or invalid `ONGOINGAI_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`.
- Fix: Set a reachable Postgres DSN and rerun targeted tests:
  `go test ./internal/configstore ./internal/trace`.

### Docs page preview looks unformatted in editor

- Symptom: `.mdx` content does not render as markdown preview.
- Cause: Editor does not map `.mdx` to markdown preview mode.
- Fix: Add the `files.associations` setting shown above.

### Pull request lacks required behavior coverage

- Symptom: Review requests more tests or docs updates.
- Cause: Behavior changed without corresponding tests or documentation.
- Fix: Add regression tests and update affected docs in the same pull
  request.
