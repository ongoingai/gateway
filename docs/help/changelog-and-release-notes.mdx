Use this page to track what changed between gateway versions.
Use it before upgrades and before publishing release tags.

## Use this page when

- You are planning an upgrade and need behavior-change details.
- You are validating a tagged release and release artifacts.
- You are preparing a pull request that changes runtime behavior.

## Source of truth

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`: Maintainer-authored release notes and milestone scope.
- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ongoingai/gateway/releases):
  tagged release artifacts and generated release summaries.
- `release/version.conf`: Active major/minor stream for auto patch tags.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Release pipeline behavior.

## Read release state quickly

1. Check the running gateway version.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   ongoingai version
   ```

2. Check recent local release tags.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   git tag --list "v*" | sort -V | tail -n 10
   ```

3. Check the next auto tag for the configured stream.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   make version-next
   ```

You should see a semantic version tag such as `v1.1.4`.

## Release workflow summary

1. Pushes to `main` and pull requests run CI checks.
   CI includes formatting checks, `go vet`, tests, race tests, and build jobs.
2. A successful push to `main` triggers auto-tagging.
   Auto-tagging reads `release/version.conf` and creates the next patch tag
   (`vX.Y.Z`).
3. Tag pushes matching `v*` trigger release publishing.
   Release workflow runs tests, builds cross-platform binaries, generates
   checksums, publishes GitHub release assets, and pushes multi-arch images to
   GHCR.

## Upgrade-impact checklist

Before upgrading:

1. Read the target section in `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
2. Verify tagged artifacts and checksums in GitHub Releases.
3. Validate config with the target binary:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   ongoingai config validate --config ongoingai.yaml
   ```

4. Follow the [upgrade and compatibility runbook](/gateway/get-started/upgrade-and-compatibility).

## Contributor expectations for release notes

- If your pull request changes runtime behavior, API behavior, auth policy,
  storage behavior, or CLI behavior, you should update `RELEASE_NOTES.md` in
  the same pull request.
- Keep notes concrete and operator-focused:
  what changed, who is affected, and what action is required.
- Include upgrade-impact callouts for any behavior that can change existing
  deployments.

## Troubleshooting

### `make version-next` fails

- Symptom: Command exits with a version-config error.
- Cause: `release/version.conf` is missing or `base_version` format is
  invalid.
- Fix: Restore the file and set `base_version` to `X.Y`, then rerun
  `make version-next`.

### Auto tag is not created after merge to main

- Symptom: CI passed on `main`, but no new `vX.Y.Z` tag appears.
- Cause: Auto-tag conditions were not met or workflow write permission is
  missing.
- Fix: Check `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` run status and repository
  Actions permission settings.

### Release artifacts are missing for a tag

- Symptom: Tag exists, but binaries or checksums are not present in GitHub
  Releases.
- Cause: `.github/workflows/release.yml` failed or did not run.
- Fix: Check workflow run logs for the tag and re-run after fixing the
  failing step.
